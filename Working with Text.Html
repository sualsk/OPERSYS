      <p>[Verse 1]<p></p>
       <p> Took a long vacation
        No make-up, just JAY-Z
        You were balls-deep, now we beefin'
        Had me butt-naked at the MGM
        So wasted, screamin', "Fuck that"
        Blurry now, but I meant it then
        Hurry now, baby, stick it in
        'Fore the memories get to kickin' in</p>
        <p>[Pre-Chorus]<p>
            <p></p>It's too late, I don't wanna lose</p>
    <p>[Chorus] <p>
    </p>What's left of you
        How am I supposed to tell you
        I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
        Nobody gets me like you
        How am I supposed to let you go?
        Only like myself when I'm with you
        Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
        You do
        Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
        You do
        Nobody gets me, you do
        You do
        Nobody gets me, you do</p>
        <p>[Verse 2] <p></p>
        <p>Took me out to the ballet
            You proposеd, I went on the road
            You was feelin' empty so you lеft me
            Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat
            If I'm real, I deserve less
            If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
            I pretend when I'm with a man it's you <p></p>
            
            <p>[Pre-Chorus] <p>
            <p>And I know that it's too late, I don't wanna lose <p></p>
            
            <p>[Chorus] <p>
                <p> What's left of you
            How am I supposed to tell you
            I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
            Nobody gets me like you
            How am I supposed to let you go?
            Only like myself when I'm with you
            Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
            You do
            Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
            You do
            Nobody gets me, you do (Do) </p>
            
            <p> [Outro] <p></p>
            <p>You do
            Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
            Nobody gets me, you do</p>
